# Concurrency

NTSC has one concurrency model: cheap stackless goroutines multiplexed onto a
multi-threaded work-stealing scheduler with a reactor for all I/O. `go` spawns
a goroutine, `chan[T]` carries typed messages between them, and `await` (on
`async fun` or the async stdlib) suspends a goroutine at an I/O point. OS
threads (`process.spawn_thread`) remain as the escape hatch for genuinely
blocking native work; the older `collections.channel` functions keep working.

```
  Goroutines (go / async)   ── thousands, cheap, stackless
                 │
        ┌────────┴─────────┐
        ▼                  ▼
  Work-stealing        Reactor (non-blocking I/O)
  scheduler            sockets / timers / channels
  OS-thread pool       readiness loop; never blocks a thread
  (= CPU count)
```

A blocked channel operation or an `await` parks the goroutine, not the thread:
the scheduler thread picks up other work, so tens of thousands of in-flight
I/O operations cost tens of thousands of cheap tasks — not OS threads.
CPU-bound goroutines spread across the whole pool.

## Goroutines

`go worker(args)` runs an async function on the scheduler; `go { ... }` runs an
inline block. Spawn is fire-and-forget: `go` returns nothing and never blocks
the caller. When `main` returns, outstanding goroutines are abandoned (as in
Go) — hand work a channel or sleep if it must finish first. Abandonment is
leak-free: the runtime reclaims an abandoned goroutine's future at shutdown,
releasing every registry value it still owned (strings, arrays, armed sleep
deadlines, channel handles), so the debug leak report stays clean. There is
no goroutine `join` in the language yet — completion is coordinated with
channels; the runtime's join machinery exists for embedders, and it is what
keeps a goroutine's result and uncaught exception readable until its handle
is dropped.

```ntsc
async fun drain(chan[string] jobs) {
    for j in jobs {
        handle(j)
    }
}

async fun main() -> int {
    var chan[string] jobs = chan.new(4)
    go drain(jobs)
    "render" |> jobs
    "package" |> jobs
    close(jobs)
    await async.sleep(50)   // give the worker time to drain
    return 0
}
```

Fan-out is just a loop:

```ntsc
for url in urls {
    go download(url)
}
```

## Channels

`chan[T]` is a typed channel. The operators show the direction data moves — the arrow points where the
value goes: `|>` pipes the value on its left into the channel on its right;
`<|` feeds the variable on its left from the channel on its right.

```ntsc
var chan[int] jobs = chan.new(10)   // buffered channel, capacity 10

value |> jobs                       // send: moves value into jobs (parks when full)
x <| jobs                           // receive: binds fresh x from jobs (parks when empty)
close(jobs)                         // no more sends; receivers drain, then get zero

for v in jobs {                     // receive until the channel is closed and drained
    handle(v)
}
```

Rules:

- `chan.new(capacity)` creates the channel; the element type comes from the
  annotated variable (`var chan[string] jobs = ...`).
- A send **moves** the value into the channel: the sender cannot use it
  afterwards (using it is `NTSC-E0501`). There is no alias and no double free.
- A receive binds a fresh variable that owns the value and frees it at scope
  exit.
- Sends and receives are legal only as statements at the top level of an
  `async fun` body (they are suspension points, like `await`); a blocked
  operation parks the goroutine instead of the thread.
- `close(ch)` forbids further sends. Values already queued are still received;
  when the buffer is drained, receives complete with the zero value and
  `for v in ch` exits.
- A channel handle may be passed to `go` (and moved through channels) freely:
  the handle is shared and the channel state lives behind the runtime's lock.

## Memory safety across goroutines

There is no `unsafe`, no interior aliasing, no manual memory anywhere. The
ownership checker classifies every value that crosses into a goroutine —
arguments to `go fn(...)` and free variables captured by `go { ... }` — with
the same total rules used for `process.spawn_thread`:

| Value crossing into a goroutine | What happens | Why it is safe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scalars (`int`, `float`, `bool`) | Copied | The goroutine shares nothing with the spawner. |
| Safe handles (channels, files, sockets, threads) | Shared | The resource lives in the mutex-guarded runtime registry; the handle itself is an `int`. The spawner keeps ownership and stays free to use the channel. |
| Function references | Copied | Code is immutable; a lambda captures nothing. |
| Owned heap values (`string`, `array`, `object`, class instances) | **Moved** | The value's owning slot is transferred into the goroutine's future; the caller cannot use it afterwards (`NTSC-E0501`), so there is exactly one owner while the goroutine runs and it is freed once at the end. |
| `view` / `view mut` | **Rejected** (`NTSC-E0501`) | A borrow may outlive the spawner's frame; a goroutine cannot hold one. Move or copy the value instead. |
| `shared` | **Rejected** (`NTSC-E0501`) | The reference count is not synchronized across threads; copies would race on both the value and its count. Send the data through a channel instead. |

For `ch <| v` the value moves into the channel; for `v |> ch` it moves out to
the receiver — at every instant a value crossing a channel has exactly one
owner.

## OS threads

`process.spawn_thread(body, arg)` starts a real OS thread — the escape hatch
for long-running native work, FFI, or tight loops that should not be
preempted. The body is a lambda with a single parameter; the argument crosses
the thread boundary under the same classification table as above, and the
handle that `process.thread_join` waits on:

```ntsc
var tx = collections.channel_sender(rx)
var producer = process.spawn_thread(fun(int tx) {
    collections.channel_send(tx, "ping")
    collections.channel_send(tx, "pong")
    collections.channel_close(tx)
}, tx)

process.thread_join(producer)
```

A goroutine is not an OS thread: prefer `go` for concurrency, and reach for
`spawn_thread` only when something must genuinely block a core.

### The legacy `collections.channel` family

`collections.channel(capacity)`, `channel_sender`, `channel_send`,
`channel_recv`, `channel_try_recv`, and `channel_close` still work for
OS-thread code (they copy string messages and block the calling thread).
New goroutine code should use `chan[T]`, which is typed and parks instead of
blocking.

### Scaling benchmarks

`benchmarks/run_concurrency.py` measures the worker pool directly: 10k–100k
goroutines on a fixed pool, CPU fan-out across cores, blocked-on-`sleep`
goroutines freeing workers, and concurrent HTTP fan-out — each side by side
with the equivalent Go goroutine program. Results land in
`benchmarks/results_concurrency.md`.

### Threading rules

NTSC has no `Send`/`Sync` traits to implement. The compiler classifies every
value handed to another thread, and the classification is total — there is
nothing to opt into and no escape hatch. A value crosses a thread boundary
when it is an argument to `go`, a capture of a `go { ... }` block, an argument
to `process.spawn_thread` (the payload), or the message of
`collections.channel_send`. The table above is that classification;
violations are ownership errors (`NTSC-E0501`) reported at compile time:

```ntsc
fun main() {
    var xs = [1, 2]
    process.spawn_thread(worker, xs)
    // error[NTSC-E0501]: cannot pass `xs` to process.spawn_thread: an owned
    // heap value would cross as a raw handle that both threads then alias
    // without synchronization, ...
}
```

A user-defined type is thread-safe exactly when its values are: a class
instance is an owned heap value, so it follows that row of the table. There is
no way to declare otherwise, which is why the rules are exhaustive.

`await` is not a thread boundary between goroutines: a suspension parks the
current goroutine and the scheduler resumes it (possibly on a different
worker), but values live in the goroutine's own future the whole time. Values
that cannot cross into a `go` are still free to live across an `await` in the
goroutine that owns them.

## Async / await

An `async fun` is a coroutine that suspends at `await` points and resumes
later. Goroutines and async futures are the same machinery: `async fun main`
runs as the root goroutine on the scheduler, and `await` parks the current
goroutine until the awaited future completes.

```ntsc
async fun fetch(string url) -> string {
    await async.sleep(10)
    return "data for " + url
}

async fun main() -> int {
    var first = await fetch("a")
    var second = await fetch("b")
    say(first)
    say(second)
    return 0
}
```

### Rules

- `async fun main` is supported and drives the root future; its `int` result
  becomes the process exit code.
- Local variables survive suspension: values written before an `await` are
  intact afterwards.
- Await results flow back into the calling coroutine after the child future
  completes.
- `try`, `throw`, and `retry` work inside async bodies. A `throw` sets
  the thread-local pending-exception flag and propagates to the caller
  after `wait_any`/`wait_all` returns. This enables the timeout pattern:
  racing an operation against a sleep that throws a catchable error.

### The `async` module

`async.sleep(ms)` pauses the coroutine for approximately `ms` milliseconds:
the future reports "pending" until the deadline passes, and the scheduler
re-polls it on a millisecond quantum.

### Awaitable I/O

Blocking stdlib calls have awaitable variants that free the scheduler thread
while the goroutine waits. They come in two flavors:

- **Reactor-backed** (`net.accept_async`, `net.recv_line_async`): the wait is
  an I/O readiness wait handled by the reactor. Each poll tries a
  non-blocking syscall first, and the goroutine parks on socket readiness
  until a client connects or bytes arrive. A server built this way serves any
  number of slow clients on a fixed thread pool.
- **Offloaded** (`http.*_async`): the blocking request runs on a bounded
  worker-thread pool, and the calling goroutine parks until the result is
  ready.

```ntsc
use net
use fmt

async fun handle_client(int sock) {
    var string line = await net.recv_line_async(sock)
    net.send_line(sock, "ok:" + fmt.i64_to_str(fmt.to_int(line) + 1))
    net.close(sock)
}

async fun accept_loop(int listener) {
    var int sock = await net.accept_async(listener)
    go handle_client(sock)
    go accept_loop(listener)   // keep accepting while this client is handled
}

async fun main() -> int {
    var int listener = net.tcp_listen(8080)
    say("listening on " + fmt.i64_to_str(net.local_port(listener)))
    go accept_loop(listener)
    await async.sleep(60000)   // serve for a while, then exit
    net.close(listener)
    return 0
}
```

`http.get_async` offloads the request to the pool the same way, so a
goroutine waiting on a response never holds a scheduler thread hostage:

```ntsc
var resp = await http.get_async("https://example.com/")
```

### Inline async blocks

Instead of writing a separate `async fun`, you can inline a block directly at
the `await` site:

```ntsc
async fun main() -> int {
    var result = await async {
        await async.sleep(50);
        return 42
    }
    say(result)  // 42
    return 0
}
```

An inline `async { ... }` block compiles to an anonymous future. It cannot
take parameters and must have a consistent return type across all paths.
A `go { ... }` block is the same machinery spawned onto the scheduler instead
of awaited; unlike an inline async block, it captures the local variables it
references (moved or shared per the table above).

### `for await`

`for await x in producer` iterates over `producer` (an array or other
iterable). It is syntactically equivalent to `for (var x in producer)` today
but signals intent to support streaming async iteration in the future.

```ntsc
async fun main() -> int {
    var items = ["a", "b", "c"]
    for await x in items {
        say(x)
    }
    return 0
}
```
