//! Core state types of the ntroutine substrate: the global scheduling and
//! parking registry, channels, goroutines, and reactor interests.
//!
//! All blocking coordination (which goroutine is parked on which channel, the
//! channel buffers, timers, and file-descriptor interests) lives under a single
//! [`Mutex`] guarded [`Global`] state, so a block/unblock decision and the
//! registration of a waiter are one atomic critical section — there is no lost
//! wakeup. Runnable goroutines are handed to per-worker local queues (see
//! [`crate::ntask::scheduler`]), so CPU-bound work spreads across the OS-thread
//! pool while I/O-bound goroutines park without tying up a thread.
