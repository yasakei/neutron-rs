# Packaging

This directory contains the recipes that produce distributable installers for
the `ntsc` compiler. CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds the release
binary on each platform and invokes these scripts whenever a `v*` tag is
pushed, then attaches the artifacts to the GitHub Release.

These recipes are **not versioned** (see `/workflows` in `.gitignore`): like
the root-level CI workflow, they live only on this machine and are kept out of
the repository. Commit them if you want the release job to work from a fresh
checkout.

The compiler links LLVM 22 **dynamically**. The native Linux packages built
from source (`.deb`, `.rpm`, and the AUR `PKGBUILD`) declare a runtime
dependency on the system LLVM; the macOS `.dmg` and the Windows `.msi` ship the
LLVM libraries alongside the binary. The portable `.tar.gz` archives (one per
platform) and the prebuilt Arch package (`.pkg.tar.zst`) go further and bundle
the LLVM libraries **and** the ntsc runtime, so they run with no LLVM install
and no toolchain.

Every package — native or tarball — ships `libntsc_runtime.a`, the static
archive `ntsc build` links each NTSC program against. An installed `ntsc`
locates it relative to its own executable (beside the binary on Windows and in
the macOS bundle; in the sibling `lib/ntsc` or, on Fedora, `lib64/ntsc`
directory on Unix prefixes), so no workspace checkout or `cargo` is needed at
build time.

## Platform notes

### Debian / Ubuntu (.deb)

`build-deb-rpm.sh` stages the binary and a gzipped man page, then runs
`dpkg-deb`. The generated `debian/control` declares a dependency on
`libLLVM-22`, the Debian/Ubuntu name for the LLVM 22 runtime (Fedora's is
`llvm-libs`), so each distro family is packaged against its own runtime.

Artifact: `ntsc_<version>_amd64.deb`

Install with: `sudo dpkg -i ntsc_<version>_amd64.deb`

### Fedora / RHEL (.rpm)

`build-deb-rpm.sh` runs `rpmbuild` against `fedora/ntsc.spec`, which requires
`llvm-libs >= 22`.

Artifact: `ntsc-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm`

Install with: `sudo dnf install ntsc-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm`

### Arch Linux (PKGBUILD + prebuilt .pkg.tar.zst)

Arch gets two independent artifacts:

**Source recipe (`arch/PKGBUILD`)** — for the AUR. It downloads the `v<version>`
tarball and builds with the system toolchain, so `makedepends` lists `cargo`,
`rust`, and `llvm`, and the runtime dependency is `llvm-libs`. `build()`
compiles both `ntsc-cli` and `ntsc-runtime`, and `package()` installs the
runtime archive to `/usr/lib/ntsc/libntsc_runtime.a`.

Install with: `makepkg -si`

**Prebuilt package (`make-arch-pkg.sh` → `.pkg.tar.zst`)** — for direct
installation with no compiling. It wraps the self-contained tarball (which
already bundles the full LLVM closure and the runtime) into a binary package
that installs `/usr/bin/ntsc` and `/usr/lib/ntsc/`. Because LLVM is bundled it
depends only on `glibc` and `gcc-libs`, so it keeps working when rolling Arch
bumps LLVM to a new soname — unlike a package linked against the system
`llvm-libs`. `makepkg` only runs on Arch and refuses to run as root, so CI
builds it inside an `archlinux` container as an unprivileged user; it must run
after `make-tarball.sh`, whose output tree it repackages. `options=('!strip')`
keeps `makepkg` from stripping `libntsc_runtime.a` (which would gut its symbol
table and break linking).

Install with: `sudo pacman -U ntsc-<version>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`

Artifact: `ntsc-<version>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`

### macOS (.dmg)

`make-dmg.sh` wraps the binary in a `ntsc.app` bundle, recursively copies the
non-system dylib closure (including Homebrew's `llvm@22` libraries) into
`Contents/Frameworks`, rewrites install names to `@rpath`, ad-hoc code signs,
and packs everything into a `UDZO` .dmg with an Applications symlink.

The bundle is a CLI tool, not a GUI app; dragging it into `/Applications` and
running `./ntsc.app/Contents/MacOS/ntsc` works, or symlink it onto your PATH.

Artifact: `ntsc-<version>.dmg`

### Windows (.msi)

`build-msi.ps1` runs `dumpbin /DEPENDENTS` to compute the DLL closure of
`ntsc.exe`, copies the non-system DLLs (from the LLVM install directory) into
the MSI, and emits a `dlls.wxs` fragment. It also stages a **self-contained
Windows link path** so `ntsc build` works on a machine with no compiler
installed:

- `ld.lld.exe` (from the LLVM bin directory) is placed next to `ntsc.exe`;
- the GNU-flavoured runtime (`libntsc_runtime.a`, built with
  `cargo build -p ntsc-runtime --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release`) is
  bundled, because `ld.lld` in MinGW mode cannot consume the MSVC-flavoured
  archive;
- the MinGW import libraries (from the rustc toolchain's
  `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` lib dir, created by
  `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`) are installed into a `mingw`
  subdirectory.

`tools.wxs` declares these files. At runtime `ntsc` prefers the bundled
`ld.lld` (found next to the executable) over `link.exe`/`gcc` on PATH, so an
MSVC or MinGW installation is no longer required for linking. The GNU-flavoured
runtime is only built for the installer; developer machines with `link.exe`
still use the MSVC-flavoured `ntsc_runtime.lib`.

`wix build` then produces an installer that installs to
`%ProgramFiles%\ntsc\bin` and supports upgrades via the `UpgradeCode`.

Because the LLVM DLLs are bundled, Windows needs no separate LLVM
installation. The installer (WixUI feature-selection dialogs) offers one
optional feature: **Add ntsc to PATH**, checked by default and toggleable at
install time, or later via Programs & Features -> Change. Unchecking it skips
the environment change entirely. The license-agreement dialog shows an RTF
conversion of `LICENSE`, generated by the script.

Requires the wix CLI: `dotnet tool install --global wix`.

Artifact: `ntsc-<version>.msi`

### Portable tarball (.tar.gz, all platforms)

Each platform also produces a **self-contained** `.tar.gz` that bundles the
compiler, the runtime archive, and the full LLVM shared-library closure, so it
runs with no LLVM install and no `cargo` toolchain. Extract it anywhere and run
`bin/ntsc` (or add the directory to `PATH`).

Artifacts:

- `ntsc-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
- `ntsc-<version>-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`
- `ntsc-<version>-windows-x86_64.tar.gz`

The Unix archives use a `bin/` + `lib/ntsc/` prefix layout and are made
relocatable so the bundled libraries resolve wherever the tree is extracted:

- **Linux** (`linux/make-tarball.sh`): `ldd` prints the flattened closure, so
  one pass copies every non-system library into `lib/ntsc`. `patchelf` sets
  `RUNPATH` to `$ORIGIN/../lib/ntsc` on the binary and `$ORIGIN` on each bundled
  `.so`. The loader and core system libraries (libc, libm, the loader,
  libgcc_s, …) are deliberately **not** bundled — a foreign libc against the
  host kernel breaks the binary — so the archive inherits the **glibc floor of
  the build machine**. Build it on the oldest distro you want to support
  (CI uses `ubuntu-latest`).
- **macOS** (`macos/make-tarball.sh`): reuses the recursive `otool -L` /
  `install_name_tool` closure walk from `make-dmg.sh`, rewriting install names
  to `@rpath/<name>` with an `@executable_path/../lib/ntsc` rpath on the binary
  and `@loader_path` on each dylib. Every Mach-O is ad-hoc re-signed after each
  edit, because editing a Mach-O invalidates its signature.
- **Windows** (`windows/make-tarball.ps1`): reuses the self-contained tree
  `build-msi.ps1` already stages at `dist\win` (ntsc.exe, DLL closure,
  `ld.lld.exe`, `libntsc_runtime.a`, `mingw\`), so it **must run after
  `build-msi.ps1`**. The layout is intentionally flat — `ntsc` resolves both
  its bundled linker and the runtime from its own directory — so it is not
  reshaped into `bin/` + `lib/`.

## Building locally

Each recipe takes the version as its first argument. The native packages and
tarballs expect the release compiler, the package-manager binary at
`crates/ntsc-pkg/build/release/ntsc-pkg` (or `.exe`), and the runtime at
`target/release/libntsc_runtime.a`:

```bash
cargo build --release -p ntsc-cli -p ntsc-runtime
(cd crates/ntsc-pkg && ../../target/release/ntsc build --release)

# Linux (.deb/.rpm require dpkg-deb/rpmbuild; the tarball requires patchelf;
# the .pkg.tar.zst requires makepkg and so only builds on Arch):
bash .github/packaging/linux/build-deb-rpm.sh 26.0.0b
bash .github/packaging/linux/make-tarball.sh 26.0.0b
bash .github/packaging/linux/make-arch-pkg.sh 26.0.0b   # Arch only; after make-tarball.sh

# macOS (requires hdiutil, otool, install_name_tool, codesign):
bash .github/packaging/macos/make-dmg.sh 26.0.0b
bash .github/packaging/macos/make-tarball.sh 26.0.0b

# Windows (requires the wix CLI and the MSVC developer environment; the
# bundled linker additionally needs the GNU runtime and MinGW import libs).
# make-tarball.ps1 reuses build-msi.ps1's staging, so run it afterwards:
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
cargo build -p ntsc-runtime --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release
pwsh .github/packaging/windows/build-msi.ps1 -Version 26.0.0b -MsiVersion 26.0.0
pwsh .github/packaging/windows/make-tarball.ps1 -Version 26.0.0b
```
